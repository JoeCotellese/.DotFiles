As more technology developed your lives have gotten a lot harder, not easier.\n\nSpend anytime talking to someone who's trying to market their product or service and you'll often here things like:\n\nWhat's the conversion rate of our landing page?\nHow much organic traffic are we getting this month?\nCan we get better CPMs from Facebook or Google AdSense?\nI have to develop 4 new blog posts plus a PDF guide by the end of the week.\nDid you see the recent comments on our Twitter page?\nHow do I get 10k new Likes on our Facebook page by the end of the month.\nWhere do we stand on the lead generation email campaign?\nWhat's the CTR on our holiday newsletters?\n\n## What's this sound like?\n\nI'm saying this and I see a lot of people shaking their heads. This sounds all too familiar doesn't it?\n\nProbably a typical week at the office for some of you.\n\n## A typical week at the office for anyone in marketing.\n\nMaybe for some of you here, a typical day in the office.\n\nTime is the enemy. There is never enough time in the day to get things done.\n\nI don't know how you have the time to do it all. Work Life Balance? More like Work Work Work.\n\nMy daughter works in the PR department at a fairly large company in the area. We spend a lot of time talking about marketing. It's really cool that we can share these experiences.\n\nShe was talking about how the woman who ran social media is up at midnight on a regular basis answering Facebook posts.\n\nMarketers are busy. Whether your run a marketing team, are part of a team there is never enough time in the day to do what you need to do.\n\nA lot of AWeber customers are solo-preneurs. I feel you pain. On top of marketing, you're trying to do everything.\n\nShow of hands how many of you in the audience have to handle your own marketing? How many of you have enough time in the day?\n\nI think a lot about the pain you feel. The soul crushing weight that presses against you in the constant drive to gain market share and grow you business. I want to help you.\n\nNo, I'm not going to log into your Twitter accounts at midnight to answer questions from your customers.\n\nI am going to introduce you to some simple things you can do today to take some of the burden off of your email marketing efforts. You can do these using some email service providers. We're proud to announce Campaigns a revolutionary new platform from AWeber that will make marketing automation easy, effective and fun.\n\n# What is Campaigns?\n\nCampaigns is a marketing automation platform that allows you to easily build out campaigns in order to engage with your audience even when your not around. Think of it as your out sourced marketing team.\n\n## Under the Hood\nWe've built a powerful engine that triggers actions based on events. We're launching it today with support for building advanced email campaigns. We've engineered it to react to all kinds of events and perform a variety of actions.\n\nThis engine is really powerful and we're proud of it but an engine is only as good as the car that is wrapped around it.\n\n## DND UI\nWe've also built an all new editor to allow you to design your campaigns using a simple drag and drop interface.\n\nYou only have to understand two concepts in order to build campaigns, no matter how simple or complex.\n\nTrigger and Action.\n\nTriggers are the things that kick off a campaign.\n\nSomeone signs up via a form on your website? It's a trigger.\n\nSomeone signs up via Atom our mobile sign up form? It's a trigger.\n\nA prospect makes a purchase and is tagged a \"Customer\" that's a trigger too.\n\nOnce you've established your trigger you tell the system how to respond to that trigger. You do that with Actions.\n\nWe're starting out with three simple Actions - Send Message, Wait and Tagged.\n\nPut these two simple concepts together and like the building blocks you played with as a child you can build simple structures or even complex advanced campaigns.\n\nSo I promised that I could help you with your email marketing burden. Let me show you with some real world examples of Campaigns in action.\n\n# Email Pro Tip 1 - Welcome Emails\nWe've had a basic form of automation built into our system since it's inception in 1998. In fact, we were the first marketing automation tool back when that term didn't exist.\n\nDespite that, many customers still only use AWeber for sending out Newsletters. Newsletters are important but you have to remember to schedule and send them. I'm trying to make your lives easier remember?\n\nIt's important to engage your subscribers the minute they sign up for your email list. The best way to do that is with a Welcome email.\n\nA welcome campaign is an automatic email or series of emails that, well, welcomes new subscribers. This is the perfect complement to your regular broadcasts, as it guarantees you make a valuable connection as soon as someone signs up to your list.\n\nWithout a welcome message, a new subscriber might go days or weeks before hearing from you. And you don’t want that. Another benefit? You can create these emails in advance, so you don’t have to worry about manually sending a message to every new subscriber.\n\nTo create a campaign, you should start by creating drafts of your emails. To help you get an idea of what to write, here are some ideas.\n\nYour first welcome message should thank subscribers for signing up, and set expectations about what you’ll be sending in future emails. Be sure to include an incentive if you offered one in your sign up form.\n\nYou can also add a brief description about your company, contact information, and a call to action. Your call to action could be a link to download an incentive or a coupon off a future purchase, or even just a link back to your website.\n\nDo note that since the idea is to let these emails work for you, you should avoid including any time-sensitive information, like a current promotion. You can update the series as needed, but it’ll be easier if you only include information that won’t change any time soon.\n\nWhile a single welcome message is perfect for engaging your subscribers, you might want to share more details about your business. To avoid overwhelming your subscribers, you can do this by adding additional messages to your welcome campaign.\n\nThe second email is perfect for helping new subscribers get started. If someone is just learning about your business, what information do they need to know to become a smarter consumer? Link to content that’ll help do just that. A baker, for example, might share more information about different desserts they make, and link back to her website.\n\nNow for your third message, why not share testimonials from your biggest fans? You can also ask for feedback that will help them be successful.\n\nOnce you have your emails created, create a new Campaign in your account and add your messages to your campaign. Once your messages are added, you can decide how far apart they’re spaced out. Set an interval between your first message and your second message. This gives you more control over when your messages are sent.\n\nWhile that’s just the basic framework for creating an educational campaign, you can adjust the details as needed for your business and your audience. For more detailed information on how to set up your campaigns, check out our Knowledge Base. If you’re ready to get started, log in now!\n\nLook how easy that was to do with Campaigns. Really simple and super effective. Look I just gave you back a couple of hours of your life. Hashtag #productive\n\n# Email Pro Tip 2 - Educate your audience.\nWelcome emails are a really important way to quickly get back to your subscribers. After they've joined your list though what next?\n\nSure you can send them a monthly newsletter but we're talking about automation here remember.\n\nHow about packaging up your content into an educational course. Educational courses are a great way to teach either prospects or customers about what your business is all about.\n\nAre you a financial consultant? Create a course that covers financial basics. Don't worry that you're giving away all your secrets. Your not. What you're doing is establishing your expertise by giving themselves something of value.\n\nYou'll stay top of mind when it's time to choose a financial consultant.\n\nSo what does an educational course look like?\nLet's say you are you a vegan food blogger. You can build a campaign that educates new readers on how to go vegan.\n\n[Email #1]\nYour first email should introduce the course your subscribers are about to take, so this is a great place to include an overview of what they should expect. Let’s say you’ve created a 3-week beginner’s course on how to transition to a vegan diet. Tell your subscribers how many emails you’ll send and how frequently they’ll get them. Also reaffirm why your subscribers are taking the course by reminding them of the benefits.\n\n[Email #2]\nThe second email should introduce basic concepts to lay the foundation of your course..You might use your second email to share an overview of what a vegan diet looks like.\n\n[Email #3]\nYour third email is a good place to dive deeper into a specific topic within your course. If you think about your course like a book, the first email is your preface, the second is your intro, and your third is chapter 1. The vegan blogger could use this email to talk about the challenges a new vegan might face, and link to blog posts that build up their confidence.\n\n[Email #4]\nFor your fourth email, you might focus on another topic that falls under your course’s theme. For the vegan blogger, you might include recipes to help subscribers transition to their new diet.\n\nYou can create as many emails in your course as you’d like, as long as they each provide value to your subscribers. Avoid being too promotional of your own products and services, since the idea is to use your content as a way to build trust with your audience. When they’re ready to buy, they’ll look to you as their trusted source.\n\nOnce your emails are drafted, go to Campaigns and create a new course. You can choose to create a campaign based on when someone is added to your list, or when a tag is applied - this will be up to you, depending on how you want people to enter your educational course.\nFor our vegan course, we’ll have subscribers join from a sign up form on our website.\n\nWe want these subscribers to receive an automated series of emails from us that contain this course. First, we’ll add our messages and select the appropriate email drafts. Once we have all of the emails in our series in place, now we can decide how far apart each message should be spaced.\n\nIf you’re not yet sure what you want to include in your email content, that’s okay! Some people might need to visualize what a campaign will look like first. If that’s the case, you can create a draft of your campaign, and simply add placeholder message blocks. When you’re ready, you can go back and add your emails.\n\nWhile that’s just the basic framework for creating an educational campaign, you can adjust the details as needed for your business and your audience.

I think one of the most important things you can do is get people onto your email list.\n\nA lot of folks tend to use Twitter and Facebook as their main communication channel to their customers. The problem is that you don't own the audience. Instead, you should leverage those channels to funnel your audience onto your email list.\n\nOnce there, it's really important to make sure your content is contectually relevant. If they signed up via Facebook, Twitter or Atom our mobile application you probably want to know that. That's where tags comes in.\n\nWith tags you can add additinal information to your subscriber data to help segment them.\n\n\n# Bonus Tip - Repurpose your content for lead generation\nCampaigns work only if you have content. Writing great content is hard though. Here's a dirty little secret\n\n\"Good Artist Copy...\"\n\nSteal your own content. Or in other words. Repurpose it.\n\nDig through your blog, you probably have a bunch of evergreen content that you've written on a variety of subjects. Turn your article on XXXX into a top 10 ways to blank or blank.\n\nSee, look I'm just throwing all kinds of time saving tips at you today.\n\n\n# Campaigns is future proof\n\nI've only scratched the surface of what is possible with Campaigns. AWeber Campaigns isn't a single product feature but the future of email marketing. We're starting out with a handful of Triggers and Actions but we've got some more great ones just around the corner.\n\n# Finé\n\nAs Marketers your time is a valuable commodity. You're pulled in a dozen different directions at once. Don't let your busy schedule keep you from engaging with your customers using one of the most powerful forms of communication.\n\nUse Campaigns to ease your marketing burden and communicate with your customer.\n\nThanks for listening, I'll be available immediately following this talk to discuss Campaigns and Marketing Automation.\n\nFor those of you tuning in, Jay is online to give you a run through of Campaigns and answer any questions.\n\n---\n","markerStore":{"nextMarkerId":13,"markersById":{"0":{"range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":0,"column":0}},"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":12,"goalScreenRange":null,"preserveFolds":true},"reversed":false,"tailed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","maintainHistory":true}},"version":2},"history":{"version":3,"nextCheckpointId":2,"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[]},"encoding":"utf8","filePath":"/Volumes/Users/jcotellese/Dropbox/text/refx - Ascend 2015 Product Launch - 2015-10-05.md","digestWhenLastPersisted":"f8630c1e614b58eb60f8fd1227ea80d82d63fb99","preferredLineEnding":null,"deserializer":"TextBuffer","version":2},{"text":"","markerStore":{"nextMarkerId":1,"markersById":{"0":{"range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":0,"column":0}},"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":8},"reversed":false,"tailed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","maintainHistory":true}},"version":2},"history":{"version":3,"nextCheckpointId":1,"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[]},"encoding":"utf8","preferredLineEnding":null,"deserializer":"TextBuffer","version":2}]},"workspace":{"deserializer":"Workspace","paneContainer":{"deserializer":"PaneContainer","version":1,"root":{"deserializer":"Pane","id":3,"items":[{"deserializer":"TextEditor","id":8,"softTabs":true,"displayBuffer":{"deserializer":"DisplayBuffer","id":9,"softWrapped":false,"tokenizedBuffer":{"deserializer":"TokenizedBuffer","largeFileMode":false},"largeFileMode":false}},{"deserializer":"TextEditor","id":12,"softTabs":true,"displayBuffer":{"deserializer":"DisplayBuffer","id":13,"softWrapped":true,"tokenizedBuffer":{"deserializer":"TokenizedBuffer","bufferPath":"/Volumes/Users/jcotellese/Dropbox/text/refx - Ascend 2015 Product Launch - 2015-10-05.md","largeFileMode":false},"largeFileMode":false}},{"deserializer":"SettingsView","version":2,"activePanelName":"Themes","uri":"atom://config"}],"activeItemURI":"/Volumes/Users/jcotellese/Dropbox/text/refx - Ascend 2015 Product Launch - 2015-10-05.md","focused":true,"flexScale":1},"activePaneId":3},"fullScreen":true,"packagesWithActiveGrammars":["language-gfm","language-hyperlink","language-todo"]},"packageStates":{"fuzzy-finder":{"/Volumes/Users/jcotellese/Dropbox/text/refx - Ascend 2015 Product Launch - 2015-10-05.md":1444483457487},"keybinding-resolver":{},"metrics":{"sessionLength":6800},"tabs":[{}],"tree-view":{"directoryExpansionStates":{"/Volumes/Users/jcotellese/Dropbox/text":{"isExpanded":true,"entries":{"archive":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}}}}},"selectedPath":"/Volumes/Users/jcotellese/Dropbox/text/refx - Ascend 2015 Product Launch - 2015-10-05.md","hasFocus":false,"attached":false,"scrollLeft":0,"scrollTop":0,"width":0}}}
